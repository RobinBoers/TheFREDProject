### The FRED Project
#### A Minecraft Java rescourcepack for FREDERICO fans.

I'm working on this recourcepack, together with my friend Sean, wich (in combination with a datapack) will introduce some really cool new features to the game. Our goal is to add seansons, more golems, a proper painting tool for mapmaking, and much more. 
We used [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) from xisumavoid as a base.

I stopped working on this project, because I didn't enjoy it anymore. I am now working on other datapacks, in wich some of the features originally created in this datapack are further developed. Below you can see links to all of those datapacks.

- BetterPainting
- RubyTools
- BetterGolems

NOTE:
The project was only for around 25% finished. Most of the code wasn't done yet, and probably isn't multiplayer-frienly yet.
