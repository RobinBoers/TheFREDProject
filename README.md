### The FRED Project
#### A Minecraft Java rescourcepack for FREDERICO fans.

I'm working on this recourcepack, together with my friend Sean, wich (in combination with a datapack) will introduce some really cool new features to the game. Our goal is to add seansons, more golems, a proper painting tool for mapmaking, and much more. 
We used [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) from xisumavoid as a base.
Below you can see wich features are done, wich still need some tweaking, and wich we haven't even started on.

### Features
#### Done
- Ore textures
- New language files (we added some fun stuff in there)
- Lapis Golem behavoir
- Invisible item frames
- Painting tool
#### Still needs some tweaking
- Seasons (colorgrading the autumn grasstexture, and deciding the interval on wich the seasons shift)
- Golems (code their general behavoir and add crafting recipes, and custom textures won't work yet on 1.15 and 1.16, because Optifine isn't fully working for those versions)
#### Not even started
- Naturally spawning the custom ores
- Leave textures (seasons)
- Spawning custom bosses (We made a Ender Giant/Zombie)
- Lead villagers with emeralds
- Make custom armor (from the custom ores)

I don't know how we're going to do all this, and I you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me at robin@geheimesite.nl

#### Notes:
For custom textures (for the golems) we use Transmobifier as base, but it doesn't work yet on Minecraft 1.15<br>
It also requires Optifine.
